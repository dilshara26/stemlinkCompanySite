          <p>
            Have you ever lost your phone and tracked it using Find My App or
            accessed your phone gallery using the drive. Having machines
            connected to the internet has brought us numerous advantages.
            Internet of things is all about connecting machinery, utensils and
            equipment to the internet, sharing data over cloud storage. IoMT is
            about internet-connected medical devices, hardware and software
            infrastructures used for multiple medical purposes. Wearable and
            remote devices would share the health data it gains over the
            internet to any location in real-time, beneficial for medical
            analysis. This gives birth to fields like bioinformatics that deals
            with an enormous number of data to figure out different patterns.
          </p>
          <h3>How does IoMT impact healthcare</h3>

          <img
            src="https://www.devprojournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/healthcare-IT-trends-e1551106993336.jpg"
            alt="healthcare medical electronics biomedical engineering"
          />

          <p>
            In-home IoMT allows the patients to share their medical data and
            reports over the internet for relevant healthcare providers' further
            advice in real-time. Telehealth is a successful method for a virtual
            consultation with higher efficiency. This is a distance
            communication methodology with any medical Institute they prefer
            worldwide and prevent the hazard of visiting a doctor for mild
            health concerns. In-hospital IoMT has shown more significant
            progress and efficiency in the past couple of years. Tele-Surgeries,
            keeping track of patient movements, and emergency care are the major
            applications of in-hospital IoMT.
          </p>
          <h3>Evolution of healthcare wearables</h3>

          <p>
            Wearables used in healthcare runs back to the history of the 13th
            century, wearing spectacles for vision adjustment purposes. In the
            mid-twenties, Holter monitor, a portable electrocardiogram device is
            introduced to measure the irregular heartbeat. Followed by that,
            different wearable devices were created worldwide to serve multiple
            health check purposes. The advancement of technology has made the
            medical wearables more advanced and smaller in size, which is
            convenient enough to fit it to your hand like a watch or wear it as
            a replacement for your wedding ring.
          </p>
          <h3>Fitness Trackers and Smart Watches</h3>
          <img
            src="https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/xiaomi-mi-band-6-review-display-close-up-scaled.jpg"
            alt="wearables medical electronic smart watches fitness trackers"
          />
          <p>
            A fitness tracker could be considered an important IoMT device out
            there in the market. According to a study, it shows 20% of the
            American population wear a smartwatch or a fit bit to track their
            fitness levels. These devices are directly connected to the mobile
            device via the internet and Bluetooth, and data is stored in cloud
            storage. These fitness data such as oxygen levels, blood pressure
            levels, heartbeat rate, calories burned, hours of sleep and number
            of steps would be a great set of data to be analyzed to diagnose
            different health conditions. Machine learning algorithms integrated
            into Fitbit apps would give a comprehensive idea of your health
            progress would alarm you when to exercise. Studies have shown people
            who uses Fitbit at the age of 40 to 60 has a low tendency of having
            issues like high blood pressure. In the recent events of Covid-19,
            we identified that having low oxygen levels as a symptom of
            Covid-19. <br /><br />
            Apple smartwatch developers are currently on technologies where
            Apple watch would track users having irregular heartbeats and send
            them a notification mentioning the stats. Further, they are working
            on sensers that can detect erratic pulse, which can be a sign of
            atrial fibrillation (AFib), increasing the risk of blood clots,
            strokes, and other related complications.
          </p>
          <h3>Motion Tracker Wearables</h3>

            alt="motion trackers wearbales pedometer electronic"
          />
          <p>
            Other than smartwatches and Fitbits, several wearables are created
            for designated purposes, such as measuring blood sugar levels, skin
            temperature levels. Further electrocardiogram measurements and
            electroencephalogram measurements are using smart wearables. Mostly
            measuring vital signs have been a crucial part of these devices.

          <h3>Smart Clothing</h3>
          <img
            src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rH8amzKJWAI/maxresdefault.jpg"
            alt="smart clothes werables internet of things"
          />
          <p>
            Smart clothing has become a latest invention in this decade, which
            would give solutions for multiple issues. Smart wearables may be
            capable of tracking irregular heartbeats, but they cannot perform
            any action back on the body to regulate it. This is where Smart
            clothing comes into place. When you wear a LifeVest, it will track
            your heartbeat. If it detects any irregularity in the heartbeat,
            LifeVest is capable of giving a shock back on your body to restore
            it. This would prevent tragic incidents such as Sudden Cardiac
            Deaths, which happens when the heartbeat is too low to pump the
            required blood to the body or when the heart stops beating abruptly.
            <br /><br />
            Further, smart clothing has been a solution for people with
            conditions like Parkinson's Tremor. These people. This is a
            condition where your body parts start shaking while still and mostly
            happens when sleeping or when the body doesn't perform any motion.
            Smart clothing can settle this issue by identifying those situations
            and reducing the shaking amplitude by 85%. <br /><br />
            Placing sensors and relevant instruments in the suitable locations
            of cloth and connecting wires through clothing textiles so that the
            user doesn't feel uncomfortable are crucial when designing these
            wearables.
          </p>
          <p>
            With technologies like quantum computing and nanotechnology, tons of
            medical devices would be available in the market for consumers. But
            using the suitable instruments made by maintaining the standard
            procedures would be an essential factor to consider when using these
            equipment in daily life.

              would help students to make sense out of what they have learnt.
              This is the reason in our classes we get lots of interesting
              creative ideas from students' end as well.
