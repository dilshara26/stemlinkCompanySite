            Robotics has come a long way from Science-Fictions to Reality in the
            21st century. Once, people believed robots were machines that looked
            like humans, as seen in the Transformers film series. Nevertheless,
            robotic appliances have been used in various industries for
            performing multiple tasks in both physical and software forms. In
            many early years, robots were just machines that performed a
            specific task such as transporting a set of goods or fixing parts of
            a car. But with the emerging of AI, how developers looked into
            robotics drastically changed, and AI-powered robots became much more
            powerful, safer and more efficient than robots programmed to do a
            specific task. At present, the field of Robotics has come to its
            spotlight with cutting-edge technologies and innovations that would
            result in promising growth in the upcoming years.
          </p>
          <h3>AI Intergrated Robots</h3>

          <p>
            Artificial intelligence has undoubtedly performed a significant role
            in automation. Branches of AI such as Neural Networks, Machine
            Learning, Natural Language Processing have given a new outlook for
            the advancement of robotics. Rather than performing a specific task,
            AI enables the robots to perform their functions more intelligently
            and productively, such as sort data and identify more efficient
            methods on their own, identify the need for repairs and alerting
            them without any human involvement, do predictive analysis on
            operation outputs with new advancements and much more. Incorporating
            cloud technologies and machine learning would allow the robots to
            learn from each other by sharing their knowledge which would
            eventually increase the efficiency and speed of deployment of
            robots.
          </p>
          <h3>Robots-as-a-service</h3>

          <p>
            The traditional business model that customers need to pay upfront
            the total cost of developing a robot has a barrier of entry for most
            startups and small or medium scale businesses. Providing Robotic
            systems as a service where the customer only needs to pay the cost
            of operation would become a better business solution for a company
            on any scale to try out and adapt to new technologies. With the
            companys' revenues getting a big hit from the pandemic, the
            pay-per-use model got colossal traction, and most of the robotic
            companies provided this service for their clients. Since interest in
            automation keeps growing exponentially, the RaaS model for robotics
            would be the next new trend for Robotic companies to adapt to meet
            the market demands. Earlier, only large companies had the potential
            to invest in automation, and the RaaS model would break the
            barricade the small-scale companies had towards automation.
          </p>
          <h3>Industrial Robots replacing Human Workers</h3>
          <p>
            A few years ago, 90% of the robots were used in the automobile
            industry, assembling parts or performing repetitive tasks. This has
            changed rapidly over the past few years. Robots are placed worldwide
            performing multiple tasks such as supply chain management, sewing,
            household activities, and even complex tasks such as providing cyber
            security and algorithm development. Besides tech companies, robotic
            technology is being heavily used in the health sector, food &
            beverage production, agriculture, and consumer & household sectors,
            which clearly shows the influence robotics and automation have on
            replacing monotonous and repetitive jobs requiring less
            intellectuality.
          </p>
          <h3>Embedded Vision and Machine Vision</h3>
          <p>
            Machine Vision employs video cameras to send the analog signals,
            which later converts them to digital signals and involves digital
            signal processing to process and send the data to a robotic system.
            This enables the machines to identify the objects in the real world.
            Operating a robot with machine vision needs a lot of energy and
            considerable space, which would definitely be costly due to its high
            performance and versatility. Embedded vision gets an edge over
            machine vision by providing a compact product that uses a
            significantly less amount of energy compared to machine vision
            technology. Embedded systems have a camera inbuilt to an image
            processor, which brings the image capturing and processing into one
            device. This forgoes the bulkiness and the weight of fully-fledged
            machine vision systems that would be useful in creating drones,
            movable bots and self-driving vehicles. Robotic companies are
            working towards developing industrial robots with machine vision
            systems that would be highly beneficial for the production plants to
            ensure the safety of workers when robots are collaborating with
            workers. Machine vision and embedded vision systems would enable the
            large warehouses to maintain their workflow smoothly, and currently,
            large-scale companies like Amazon incorporate this technology for
            their daily operations. Self-driving cars would be considered the
            next most giant leap in the transportation industry. Companies like
            Tesla, Waymo, Ford are taking the upper hand in engineering
            self-driving cars using embedded vision technologies.
          </p>
          <h3>New Robot Configourations</h3>
          <p>
            As Moore's law states speed and capabilities of these
            computational-based applications would increase over time while we
            pay lesser. This has allowed everyone to purchase robotic equipment
            according to their needs for an affordable price. The floor cleaning
            bot became a famous robotic invention that took the robotic products
            to the domestic and household market. Within the next couple of
            years, more robotic appliances would be created targeting households
            to ease day-to-day activities for a more affordable price range. We
            could expect to witness robots that would replace even highly
            intellectual jobs in the future. Google is currently working on a
            machine-learning robot that could create machine learning models
            according to customer needs. This is similar to creating robots that
            could create robots that would happen soon. Also, Goole company has
            stated once that Google search wouldn't be just typing words on a
            search bar in the future, but it would be more of a live
            conversation with a robot who would assist you in finding the exact
            content you are looking for. Imagine talking to a person who knows
            every single detail on Google and could feed you those data in real
            time in any format you wish. That would be just Mind-blowing.
