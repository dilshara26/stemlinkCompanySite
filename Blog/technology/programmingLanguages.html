          <p>
            Well, if you are new to the IT industry or willing to join in
            sooner, finding a perfect programming language to start learning
            would have been a pressing question you are having. Sorry to break
            this sooner, but honestly, how many programming languages you know
            or learning the most trending programming language is not the
            primary requirement to be an excellent software engineer. But being
            well familiar with at least one programming language and having a
            solid base on modules like data structures and algorithms would
            matter a lot. But here's the thing, sometimes the first programming
            language you are starting to learn would sometimes influence you to
            be inclined towards a specific field. A person who starts coding
            with Javascript would lean towards web development. At the same
            time, another programmer who enters the industry through learning
            swift would have a higher tendency to work on developing IOS apps.
          </p>
          <h3>A brief intro</h3>
          <p>
            A Programming language is simply a vocabulary with grammatical rules
            to instruct a computer or machine to perform a specif task. A
            programming language has a unique word set called keywords to
            understand and syntaxes to organize its structure. Programming
            languages could be broadly categorized into two levels as High-Level
            programming languages and Low-Level programming languages. Low-Level
            programming languages such as machine code are more easily
            understood by computers and are not human-friendly. In contrast,
            High-Level programming languages are more readable for humans but
            complex, which requires assembly languages to act as the mediator to
            convert high-level code to machine languages. The languages above
            high-level, such as python, which is written using the high-level
            language C++, could be considered a fourth-generation language.
          </p>
          <h3>Languages that are worth for learning in the future</h3>
          <p>
            PYPL index is a great indicator for figuring out the current
            industry trends for programming languages. I would suggest not
            deciding purely by looking at that graph, but it's essential to
            determine what kind of pathway you are willing to take after
            learning it or what inspires you the most to learn to program. This
            blog will point out key takeaways of several mostly used programming
            languages in the past few years.
          </p>
          <h3>Python</h3>
          <img
            src="https://ed-matrix.com/pluginfile.php/35268/course/summary/python-programming-for-beginners-2019.jpg"
            alt="python stackoverflow survey"
          />
          <p>
            Data Science and Machine Learning have shown an exponential trend of
            growth in the past couple of years, and python is considered to be a
            language that has great tools and libraries specializing in Data
            Science. Data science applications such as auto-driving cars,
            automated robots, and predictive analysis would result in massive
            innovations in the future. Since python is a beginner-friendly
            language and closer to human language, it would be an excellent
            starter for programming beginners. The world's biggest platforms
            like Google, YouTube, Instagram, Dropbox, and Quora were built using
            python. Other than data science, python could be used in a wide
            range of fields like backend development, web scraping, game
            development, and much more According to PYPL ranking, python holds
            number 1 in the chart.
          </p>
          <h3>JavaScript</h3>
          <img src="javascript.png" alt="javascript front end development client side development stack overflow developer survey" />
          <p>
            JavaScript is a more versatile language heavily used in web
            development for both the client-side and server-side. JavaScript is
            a beginner-friendly programming language that only needs a text
            editor and a browser to run the code. JavaScript contained popular
            run times and frameworks such as Vue.js, Node.js, Angular.js, and
            React.js. Libraries like React.js would allow the users to build
            mobile native applications, which would show a significant trend in
            mobile app development shifting towards hybrid development
            technologies. Further, with the latest integrations like the
            Tensorflow JS library, JavaScript enables the opportunity to code
            machine learning algorithms. JavaScript contains tons of other
            libraries useful for game development and digital design creation.
            JavaScript has a large development community worldwide, and
            javascript developers are considered highly paid developers in this
            decade. Learning JavaScript would give you a greater edge in joining
            the digital development world.
          </p>
          <h3>Swift or Kotlin</h3>
          <img
            src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1838/1*qFJypD7CfSDRqQUXm7q99w.png"
            alt="swift kotlin ios development mobile android development"
          />
          <p>
            Having a recurring income after several really passionate projects
            would be every developer's dream. Creating a useful tool or an
            application by identifying community needs and making it visible on
            Google Play Store and Apps Store would be a better solution for
            achieving this. Learning Swift would enable you the opportunity to
            create IOS applications, and Kotlin would serve its purpose for
            Android devices. Throughout the past couple of years, Swift and
            Kotlin appeared to be stable programming languages with a
            fast-growing community around them. These languages are
            beginner-friendly and can be considered more simplified versions of
            earlier app development languages like Java and Objective-C.
          </p>
          <h3>Go</h3>
          <img
            src="https://matob.web.id/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2020/11/go.png"
            alt="go lang"
          />
          <p>
            Go AKA Golang was first developed by the Google dev team in 2007 to
            reduce the complexity of their codebase infrastructure. In 2012 Go
            was released to the public as an open-source project, and over the
            past decade, this language was heavily adapted by many tech
            corporations. Go would resolve many scalability problems in
            languages like Java. As you know, almost any programming language
            can be used for cloud application development. Out of them, several
            languages would stand out over the others. Go is considered one of
            them due to the simplicity of the language and its ability to write
            high-performance programmes. Go support multi-threading and has high
            efficiency in concurrent programming environments. Go was used to
            code highly used infrastructure tools such as Kubernetes and Docker,
            proving that Golang is a leader in cloud-based programmes.
          </p>
          <h3>Java</h3>
          <img
            src="https://www.cybersuccess.biz/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/interesting-facts-about-java-programming-language.jpg"
            alt="java object oriented programming"
          />
          <p>
            Well, here comes the debate of this decade. Undoubtedly, Java has
            become the all-time competitive grandfather of most object-oriented
            programming languages. Java has become one of the most used
            programming languages in many cooperate world infrastructures. Java
            can be used in a broad range of fields such as mobile app
            development, web application development, game development and much
            more. Over the past couple of years, Java has shown a slight decline
            in user interest and usage due to the release of cutting edge
            programming languages such as Go, Swift and Kotlin. Learning Java
            would be slightly complicated compared to the programming languages
            mentioned above. But still, there's an enormous community worldwide
            for Java, and many job opportunities are there for Java developers.
            So, spending some time learning Java would be still worth it.
