            'Interstellar' has become one of the favorite movies of any Sci-Fi
            enthusiast. It's an astonishing creation done by the well-known film
            director Christopher Nolan who has also been the producer of
            mind-blowing movies like Tenet and Inception. Interstellar movie was
            framed around a space exploration mission beyond the galaxy
            searching for a planet suitable for a human territory. The movie
            includes tons of physical concepts such as gravitational time
            dilation, quantum entanglement, the singularity of a black hole,
            neutron stars, multi-dimensional realities, Bootstrap paradox and
            much more. Therefore when understanding the concept of time
            dilation, Interstellar would set a great visual foundation to
            understand it practically. Time dilation could be simply said as the
            slow down in the flow of time due to the effects of gravitational
            force or relative velocity. Before we dig in deep, time dilation was
            first discovered by sir Albert Einstein, and there are interesting
            stories that explain how he first got the idea to research this
          </p>
          <h3>Gravitational Time dilation</h3>

          <p>
            As you know, gravity is the force by which a planet or a particular
            body draws other objects towards its center and that's why all the
            planets are in orbit around the sun. The time dilation due to
            gravity could be explained using the space-time cloth. The time
            curvature is happening in the 4th dimension and since we cannot
            sense the behavior in the 4th dimension, we assume our space as
            two-dimensional and the depth as the 3rd dimension for explanation
            purposes. Space-time cloth is a hypothetical stretchable cloth. When
            you place an object with a lesser density, you could see a low
            curvature in the cloth, and if you place an object with a higher
            density, you could see a very high curvature in space-time cloth or
            in other words, a high curvature in time. The higher the curvature
            in time, the lesser the flow of time, and the lesser the curvature
            would cause the time to flow relatively fast. The gravitational pull
            of a planet or body acting on other objects towards it's centre
            depends on the radius and the mass of that planet or body. Higher
            the mass and lesser the radius of a particular body, the
            gravitational pull towards the center of that body would be high.
            When the gravitational force is high, the curvature of time would be
            increased, and the time flow would slow down.
            <br />
            <br />
            According to the given equation, Universal Gravitational Constant
            and the speed of light stays as contents. So, when the mass and the
            radius of the planet increase and decrease, respectively, the time
            dilations would be high, or else time flow would slow down. The
            singularity in the black hole has an infinitely large mass and an
            infinitely small volume which would cause to have a compelling
            gravitational force towards its center for an extent where the flow
            of time would stop at the event horizon of the black hole.
          </p>
          <h3>Time Dilation in Interstellar</h3>

          <p>
            Christopher Nolan has successfully visualized this concept in two
            significant situations in the movie. When Cooper and his crew landed
            in the spaceship on the Millers' planet, they clearly state that
            Miller's planet has a 130% higher gravitational force than the
            earth, and 1 hour here would be seven years on earth. The reason for
            high gravitational force is that Miller's planet was closer to
            Gagentua Blackhole. As mentioned above, closer to black holes,
            there's a significant slow down in time due to very high
            gravitational force in a singularity. Before they landed the
            spaceship on Miller's planet, Cooper's daughter's age was around 14
            years and Cooper's age was 35. But after spending just three hours
            on Miller's planet, when cooper took a call to his daughter, she
            said that this was her 35th birthday. This means for the 3 hours
            Cooper has spent on Miller's planet; his daughter has aged more than
            21 years. This scenario vividly explains the extent time would slow
            down in greater gravity surfaces relative to earth.
            <br /><br />
            In the second level of comparison, we could consider the situation
            where Romiley ages 23 years than the rest of the crew. Cooper
            realized that instead of orbiting around Miller's planet, he decided
            to take a wider orbit like endurance to conserve fuel and time. But
            they forgot to consider the time shift in the endurance and Miller's
            planet. At this point, Romiley decided to stay on board endurance to
            study the black hole and the rest of the crew landed on Miller's
            planet using a Ranger. The surprising fact was that, when the crew
            returns to the spaceship after spending close to 3 hours on Miller's
            planet, Romeily has spent 23 years on the spaceship waiting for the
            crew to return.

            <br />
            <br />
            Here comes the mind-thriller part in the movie. First you get see
            Cooper falling in to the black hole and in the ending, you see him
            surviving. An object that falls inside a black hole would be
            horizontally crushed and vertically stretched by an infinitely large
            force, making the survival of cooper questionable. Different
            arguments stating that before he falls in, 5th-dimensional humans
            rescued him and sent him towards a Tesseract. Another group of
            people argues that he fell into the black hole, discovered the
            singularity characteristics, and sent those data backwards the time
            so that Murph could solve the equation of manipulating the gravity.
            <br /><br />
            However, the most exciting part is that, even though cooper spent
            just several hours inside the black hole, after waking up in the
            Cooper station, he found his daughter has grown much older and is
            more than a hundred years old. Also, Cooper found himself 124 years
            old relative earth even though he has spent just a few months or
            weeks for the whole space journey relative to him after leaving the
            earth.

              would help students to make sense out of what they have learnt.
              This is the reason in our classes we get lots of interesting

          <p>
            Gravitational time dilation is a broad topic involving multiple
            physical theories, and the more you research this, the more you feel
            inclined to explore further.
