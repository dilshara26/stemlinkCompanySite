            Back in 18th century oil became the driving force of machinery
            technology and new inventions. But the fun fact is that no matter
            how gigantic oil reservoirs you have, without refining oil all those
            oil reservoirs would be just nothing, SO DO DATA. And we are here at
            21st century, in each 10 minutes we collect data more than the data
            collected from prehistoric time to year 2003 which would eventually
            be the world's largest virtual reservoir. But then again without
            creating a meaning out of Data, Data is just another raw material
            like oil. This is where all the Data Science, Data Analytics and all
            the other related industries have been originated. In this article I
            would give you a brief intro to Data related fields and hopefully
            would tackle few misconceptions people have on this field. Data
            Science is a domain of study which uses scientific methods,
            Statistical theorems, algorithms and computational techniques to
            extract hidden patterns and insights out of a set of Raw Data or a
            large set of Data. So, the problem arises how this is different from
            what statisticians were doing over a long period. Let me explain
            this from clashing one of the most popular norms that we have in the
            industry. Most people believe that Analysis and Analytics carries
            the same meaning which is ABSOLUTELY NOT.
          </p>
          <img src="datascience IN.png" alt="data science data analytics machine learning prediction model" />

          <p>
            The above chart would give you a basic idea about how Analysis
            differs from Analytics. Analysis is all about creating a meaningful
            insight on events that has occurred in past using Data. On the other
            hand, Analytics is more about predicting the potential of future
            events using Data and Analysis information both. But for the sake of
            generalizing everything and ease of using terms, let’s consider
            analysis are also a specialized branch of analytics. Most of the
            companies would consume only 2 aspects of Data Analytics. 
            <ol style="margin-left: 40px;">
                <li>Descriptive Analytics – What Happened</li>
                <li>Diagnostic Analytics – Why did it Happen </li>
            </ol>
            
             
            But Data Science is a field which evolved far away
            from these aspects. After exploring above 2 stages you can move to
            the next levels of analytics.
          </p>
          <img src="datascience IN1.jpg" alt="machine learning deep learning predictive modelling data analytics">
          <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Predictive Analytics – What will happen? <br>
                    At this stage we would model the possibilities of events that would occur in future. For an example by looking at the number of Covid-19 patience in past few months, we could try to build a model to predicts the future patient numbers in a specific timeline.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Prescriptive Analytics – How can we make/not make it happen? <br>
                    This about an intelligent model of taking its own decisions and adjusting its parameters accordingly. For an example we can think of a ship line which is modeled to control by an intelligent system which all the ships would stay connected to each other by tracking each other’s movement and the system itself would take the decision of assigning relevant ships to travel different regions by considering different parameters in the most efficient manner.
                    Machine Learning is under the paradigm of Supervised learning where you have been given a data set that would train the system to take future decisions intelligently
                    
                    And here we come the second level of clashing the norms in the industry. The company HR manager expects the Data Scientist to perform as the Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Data Engineer, Data Architect and even as the Business Analyst. Even though these fields show highly interconnected, technical wise there are specific disciplines for each of these roles. 
                </li>

            Data Analyst – Data Analyst would be the person who would plan all the means and methods to gather the relevant information and Data that is needed to make data driven predictions. 
            · <br> Data Scientist – The key role of Data Scientist would be cross functioning with IT teams, building up statistical and mathematical models which would predict the future business action plans. A Data Scientist would need to have an understanding on Statistics, Mathematics, Computer fundamentals, and Machine Learning.
            <br><br> Data Engineer – Data Engineers would carry on the work on the foundation laid by Data Scientists. They would convert the algorithms to prototype models, ease the Data Accessibility and create the Dashboards, reports and tools for users. 
            <br><br> Data Architect – Data Architect would be responsible for maintaining the relational Databases in the company and visualizing Data for end-users in the company.
